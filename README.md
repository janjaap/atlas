## Requirements
- npm
- Webpack
- Java JRE (needed to run protractor)

## Installations
- npm install
- NODE_ENV=development npm start
- Open the server at http://localhost:8080/

## Other useful commands
- npm test
- grunt build-release
- npm run clean

## E2E testing
Make sure the app is running locally by running `grunt`.
Then, in a second terminal, run `grunt test-e2e`.

In order to run the E2E tests, the following environment variables should be set:
- `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE`
- `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE_PLUS`
- `USERNAME_EMPLOYEE`
- `USERNAME_EMPLOYEE_PLUS`
They can simply be added by using the `export` command from the command line, or by providing the variables as a
prefix to the desired command, e.g. `PASSWORD_EMPLOYEE=password grunt test-e2e`.
